The purpose of the application is to easily and conveniently allow workers to raise issues and solutions with pictures if available to be stored in a MySQL database. The invocation team will then be able to sort through and rate these issues and solutions. The issues and solutions will be filled out on a form in the form of a questionnaire. The rating will be handled by a predetermined matrix and submitted as a form. The workers will also be able to search through old issues and solutions and submit there own solutions
