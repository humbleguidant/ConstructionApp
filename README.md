# Construction App
This mobile application facilitates the submission of issues found on job sites, solutions to issues reported on job sites, as well as the rating and review of said solutions. The purpose of the application is to easily and conveniently allow workers to raise issues and solutions with pictures if available to be stored in a MySQL database. The invocation team will then be able to sort through and rate these issues and solutions. The issues and solutions will be filled out on a form in the form of a questionnaire. The rating will be handled by a predetermined matrix and submitted as a form. The workers will also be able to search through old issues and solutions and submit there own solutions
